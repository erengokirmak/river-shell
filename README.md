# River-Shell

My very limited implementation of a linux shell in Rust.

# Goals
My primary goals for the project are as such:

- [x]  Implement a search function to find binaries of commands.
- [x] Implement a command execution for commands without pipes and with arguments.
- [x] Implement a verifier to check whether a command is valid.
- [ ] Implement piping.
- [ ]  (Bonus) implement outputting to a file.
